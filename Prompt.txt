You are helping me set up and run a frontend project called
“PAIMANA Infrastructure Project Tracker”.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This is a frontend-only MVP built with Next.js (React) that visualizes
major Indian infrastructure projects using mock data derived from
PAIMANA (MoSPI) reports.

The app currently:
- Displays a searchable table of projects
- Shows a bar chart of most delayed projects
- Renders an interactive map with project markers
- Uses mock data stored locally (no backend yet)

TECH STACK:
- Node.js (v18+)
- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Recharts (charts)
- Leaflet + React-Leaflet (maps)

PROJECT STRUCTURE (IMPORTANT):
The repository root contains:
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- next.config.*
- src/

Inside src/:
- src/app/page.jsx → main dashboard page
- src/components/ → React components
  - ProjectTable.jsx
  - DelayChart.jsx
  - ProjectMap.jsx
  - ProjectMapInner.jsx
- src/data/projects.json → mock project data

NOTE:
- There must be ONLY ONE app folder inside src/app
- If a root-level app/ folder exists, it should be deleted
- node_modules is NOT committed and must be installed locally

GOAL:
Explain and execute the exact steps required to run this project
on a completely fresh device (Windows/Mac/Linux).

WHAT YOU MUST PROVIDE:
1. Prerequisites to install (Node.js, npm)
2. Exact terminal commands in order to:
   - Clone the repo
   - Install dependencies
   - Run the dev server
3. How to verify the app is running correctly
4. Common issues and fixes:
   - Port 3000 already in use
   - "window is not defined" (React-Leaflet SSR issue)
   - Seeing the default Next.js page instead of the app
5. Clear instructions, no assumptions, beginner-safe

DO NOT:
- Add a backend
- Add Python or requirements.txt
- Change project structure
- Introduce Docker or advanced tooling

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Step-by-step numbered instructions with code blocks where needed.
Keep it concise, practical, and correct.
